Before entering into the details of  `EDIpack2.0` structure, we take a moment to illustrate the functioning of the library through two distinct examples. In the first we use the library as a solver for a single impurity Anderson problem with a given discretized bath. In the second we illustrate the use as a solver within a simple Dynamical Mean-Field Theory calculation.
