Further examples
#########################

In this section we present more elaborated examples to illustrate 
other features of the `EDIpack2.0` library.

Specifically, we shall present three examples one for each value of
the :f:var:`ed_mode` variable selecting the type of symmetry,
i.e. quantum number conservation, available in the code. 
These examples can be used as a starting point to develop other
problem specific driver.  

In the first section we discuss the solution of the interacting BHZ
model without additional symmetry breaking as a non-trivial example of
multi-orbital problem. Next, we consider the solution of the
attractive Hubbard model as a simple description of s-wave
superconductivity. Finally, we consider the description of in-plane triplet
exciton condensation in the interacting BHZ model to illustrate the
use of `EDIpack2.0` in cases where spin-SU(2) symmetry is not
present.
