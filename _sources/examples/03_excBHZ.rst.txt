In-plane excitons in quantum spin Hall insulators
#####################################################

In this finale example we discuss an interesting symmetry breaking
case in the same QSHI model introduced in :doc:`01_bhz`.
Specifically, we consider the case of excitonic condensation described
by the order  parameters :math:`\vec{E}=[E_0,E_1,E_2,E_3]`  which, in terms of the Gamma
matrices, read :math:`E_a = \langle \psi_i^\dagger \Gamma_{a1} \psi_i
\rangle`.

The analysis of the impurity susceptibilities in the previous section,
suggest a possible instability towards the in-plane triplet exciton
state :math:`E_1` or :math:`E_2`. Interestingly, the onset of this
state breaks several symmetries, e.g. time-reversal and spin SU(2).
As thus, this is a physical case to investigate the :f:var:`ed_mode` =
**nonsu2** mode in `EDIpack2.0`. 


The considerations about the model Hamiltonian and the non-interacting
solution remain identical to the previous case :doc:`01_bhz`. Here we
discuss how to change the program to tackle the specific issue of
in-plane exciton condensation in QSHI.

The general structure of the code is unchanged but for one important
part: the bath construction. We get:

.. code-block:: fortran
   :linenos:

      
   !> Get local Hamiltonian summing over k (one can do better)
   allocate(Hloc(Nso,Nso))
   Hloc = sum(Hk,dim=3)/Lk
   where(abs(dreal(Hloc))<1d-6)Hloc=zero
   !> Set H_{loc} in EDIpack2
   call ed_set_hloc(Hloc)
   !> Get bath dimension and allocate user bath to this size
   ! ~removed~[Nb=ed_get_bath_dimension()]~
   !> Setup the replica bath basis for the case E0EzEx(singlet,tripletZ,tripletX)
   allocate(lambdasym_vector(Nbath,4))
   allocate(Hsym_basis(Nso,Nso,4))
   Hsym_basis(:,:,1)=Gamma5  ;lambdasym_vector(:,1)= Mh
   Hsym_basis(:,:,2)=GammaE0 ;lambdasym_vector(:,2)= sb_field
   Hsym_basis(:,:,3)=GammaEz ;lambdasym_vector(:,3)= sb_field
   Hsym_basis(:,:,4)=GammaEx ;lambdasym_vector(:,4)=-sb_field
   !> Set the replica bath
   call ed_set_Hreplica(Hsym_basis,lambdasym_vector)
   !> Get bath dimension and allocate user bath to this size
   Nb=ed_get_bath_dimension(4)   !(Hsym_basis)
   allocate(Bath(Nb))
   !
   !> Initialize the ED solver (bath is guessed or read from file) 
   call ed_init_solver(bath)


We first generate a basis of 4 matrices
:math:`O_i=[\Gamma_{03},\Gamma_{01},\Gamma_{31},\Gamma_{11}]` and a
set of parameters :math:`\vec{\lambda}^p=[ \lambda^p_1,\lambda^p_2,\lambda^p_3,\lambda^p_4]`
which will be used to parametrize any bath Hamiltonian as :math:`h^p
=\sum_i \lambda_i^p O_i`.
The rest of the implementation is unaltered, except for a couple of
printing flags.

We can now discuss some results obtained with this `EDIpack2.0` code concerning the
exciton condensation in QSHI. More results can be found in `PhysRevB.107.115117`_. 

.. _PhysRevB.107.115117: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.115117



To make a connection with the disordered case,  we consider here :math:`M=1` and fix the Hund's
exchange to :math:`J/U=0.25`. Then we illustrate the effect of raising
the interaction strength :math:`U`.
In the top panels of the following figure we report the evolution
(from left to right) of the spectral functions :math:`-\Im
G_{a=1,2}(\omega)` for increasing :math:`U` in the three different
phases of the system, respectively: QSHI (:math:`U=2`),  Excitonic
insulator (:math:`U=4`)   and Mott insulator  (:math:`U=6`).
Quite interestingly the spectral functions in the first two cases
reveal an almost identical gap size at low energy.

Yet, a closer look at the topological Hamiltonian :math:`H_{top}` show
the completely different the low-energy effective band structure.
In panel D we show the expected behavior for a QSHI, featuring a band inversion
around the topological gap and full spin symmetry. In panel E however,
we observe a much larger energy separation and the breaking of spin
degeneracy.

In order to better assess the nature of the state interposing between
the QSHI and the Mott insulator, we report in the next figure the
behavior of the in-plane triplet excitonic order parameter
:math:`\langle E_x \rangle`. As the critical strength at about
:math:`U\simeq 4` is reached we observe a sharp discontinuous
formation of a broken symmetry state with a finite order parameter.
Further increasing the interaction strength the value of
:math:`\langle E_x \rangle` decreases slowly towards zero signalling
the continuous transition to a Mott state (which can be possibly
unstable towards magnetic ordering, neglected in this calculation).

For comparison we report in the same figure also the evolution of the
orbital polarization :math:`\langle T_z\rangle` and of the correlation
strength :math:`\theta` defined as the deviation from a constant,
mean-field, behavior of the sele-energy function.
The first quantity has a decreasing behavior with a small
discontinuity at the QSHI to EI transition, while it continuously
vanishes at the Mott transition. Interestingly, the correlation
strength which is smoothly increasing in the QSHI, shows a sudden
increase in the EI reaching large values to finally settle down to a
linearly increasing  behavior in the Mott state.
