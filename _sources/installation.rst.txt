#####################

EDIpack2.0 is available in the form of a static Fortran library
`libedipack2.a` and the related Fortran module `EDIPACK2`.
Installation is available using CMake. In the current release the
library enables standard Fortran API and Python API `EDIpy2`. 


Building
======================

We assume that `SciFortran` and `MPI` have been correctly installed
and are available in the system. See related documentation. Note that
the installation of `EDIpack2.0` closely follows the `SciFortran`
template.


Clone the repo:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   git clone https://github.com/edipack/EDIpack2.0 EDIpack2



Optionally define the fortran compiler:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   export FC=mpif90/gfortran/ifort


From the repository directory (`cd EDIpack2`) make a standard
out-of-source CMake compilation:

**GNU Make**

Using GNU `make` is the default CMake workflow, with widest version
support (CMake > 3.0). Note that parallel `make` execution is tested
and working.

.. code-block:: bash
		
   mkdir build 
   cd build  
   cmake .. 
   make -j



**Ninja**

Using `ninja` if a fortran-capable version of `ninja
<https://ninja-build.org>`_ is available in your system (and CMake can
take advantage of it), you can use it to build the library at lightning, multi-threaded, speed. 

.. code-block:: bash
		
   mkdir build    
   cd build  
   cmake -GNinja ..  
   ninja

The `CMake` compilation can be customized using the following
additional variables:   

.. list-table:: CMake Options
   :widths: 30 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Scope
     - Value
       
   * - :code:`-DPREFIX`
     - prefix directory  
     - ~/opt/EDIpack2/VERSION/PLATFORM/[GIT_BRANCH]
       
   * - :code:`-DUSE_MPI`
     - MPI support pre-compilation flag
     - yes/True OR no/False (default: True)

   * - :code:`-DVERBOSE`
     - Verbose CMake output 
     - yes/True OR no/False (default: True, superseded by :code:`make VERBOSE=yes/no`

   * - :code:`-DBUILD_TYPE`
     - Compilation flags
     - RELEASE/TESTING/DEBUG/AGGRESSIVE (Default RELEASE)

..
   TESTING:mild or no optimization,  DEBUG:relevant debugging options,  
.. warning::
   
   :code:`BUILD_TYPE=AGGRESSIVE`  includes many deep level debug options which might not compile on some systems or breakdown compilation at linking step.  


Install
======================

System-wide installation is completed after the build step using either:

.. code-block:: bash

   make install

or

.. code-block:: bash
		
   ninja install

  
Please follow the instructions on the screen to complete installation on your environment.  
The library can be loaded using one of the following, automatically generated, files :  

*  A generated `environment module`_ , installed to`~/.modules.d/EDIpack2/<PLAT>`
  
* A generated `bash` script at `<PREFIX>/bin/configvars.sh`, to be sourced for permanent loading.

*  A generated `pkg-config`_ file to, installed to `~/.pkg-config.d/EDIpack2.pc`

.. _pkg-config: https://github.com/freedesktop/pkg-config


Uninstall
===================

Although CMake does not officially provide uninstall procedures in the
generated Make/Ninja files. Hence SciFortran supplies a homebrew
method to remove the generated files by calling (from the relevant
build folder):

.. code-block:: bash
		
   make uninstall

or

.. code-block:: bash
		
   ninja uninstall




Install Python API
======================
The `edipy2` python module is installable from this folder via:

.. code-block:: bash
		
    pip install .



.. note::
   On some systems such as Debian >= 11 and Mac Os,
   and if a virtual environment is not in use, the flag
   `--break-system-packages` has to be set. This creates no issue
   since no distro is packaging this library.
   

To remove the module, run:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   pip uninstall -y edipy2

with same caveat for the `--break-system-packages` flag.


.. tip::

   See `EDIpy2` documentation for more details on installing the `python` API.
