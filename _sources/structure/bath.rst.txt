Bath Auxiliary
++++++++++++++++

In this set of modules we implement a number of auxiliary procedures
which are required to enumerate the bath levels, performs all the
relevant checks on the user input bath, build up of the
:code:`replica/general` matrix basis or apply given symmetry operation
on the user side.

Bath DMFT
+++++++++++++

In :f:mod:`ed_bath_dmft` we implement operations on the  :f:type:`effective_bath` data
structure: a suitable representation of the effective bath used
internally in the code. We refer to the generic shared instance of this bath
as :f:var:`dmft_bath`.  Depending on the value :f:var:`bath_type` this quantity collect
different bath parameters which can be directly accessed in the
construction of symmetry sectors Hamiltonian.

Bath Functions
++++++++++++++++

In :f:mod:`ed_bath_functions` we implement on-the-fly construction of
the hybridization functions :math:`\Delta(z) = \sum_p
\hat{V}^p\left[z-\hat{h}^p \right]^{-1}\hat{V}^p`, as well as of the
non-interacting Anderson Green's functions
:math:`G_0(z) = \left[z +\mu - H_{loc} - \Delta(z) \right]^{-1}` for
all different cases selected by :f:var:`ed_mode` and :f:var:`bath_type`.
